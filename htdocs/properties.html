          <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=1200+Harris+Avenue,+Bellingham,+WA+98225" class="link">Sycamore Square</a> is a landmark building, providing thirty-two quality office spaces and retail shops right at the center of Fairhaven. This prominent location offers convenient access for offices and marketing opportunities for restaurants and retails.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built in 1890, Sycamore Square was originally known as the Mason Block. It was renamed the Market Place in the 1970s. The year 1994 saw a major interior renovation that included improvements to the building layout as well as the reintroduction of much detailed woodwork. Despite these changes, Sycamore Square retains the rugged brick exterior, the intricate soffit designs, and the broad arched windows that have always distinguished this building.

          Sycamore Square continues to set the standard for historical architecture while providing office and retail spaces for local businesses. Want to join the Square community? Contact us today!
